-   **Non-Monopoly:** Islam prohibits monopolies that give undue
    advantage to a single entity.
-   **Non-Gamble:** Gambling and excessive risk-taking are discouraged,
    as they involve betting on outcomes outside of one\'s control.
-   **Usurious Banking:** Charging or paying interest on loans is
    considered usurious and is forbidden in Islamic finance.

Quotex adheres to these Islamic finance principles, making it a halal
trading platform:

-   **Non-Monopoly:** Quotex operates in a competitive market with
    numerous other trading platforms.
-   **Non-Gamble:** Quotex offers binary options trading, which involves
    predicting the direction of an asset\'s movement within a specified
    time frame. While there is some risk involved, it is not considered
